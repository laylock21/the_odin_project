The purpose of this exercise is to practice our own understanding of each lesson we've encounter so far.
Building a deeper meaning through insights by note-taking, analyzing and further research helps. But by
doing regular drills to nudge our brain into the right direction helps a ton more because it reinforces 
our knowledge.

We'll tackle the following topics below starting with;
- Boilerplate (external CSS, meta data, viewport, title)
- Specificity (Order and Hierachy)
- Flexbox (Display elements, box-sizing)

The goal of this exercise is to simply play around with boxes altering its shape and position. The better
we appreciate how to manipulate, the better the future lessons go.
